# 41189-My-Reflective-Portfolio
## Week 1:

What have I learnt this week?
Focusing on a 3-hour tutorial after the long semester break  was rather difficult for me in relation to staying focused for the entirety of the class. However, despite this struggle, I was able to learn the definition and characteristics of a system. Specifically, I learnt the components of a system and how they interrelate with each other to execute a task. In addition to this, I learnt an overview of what complex systems are and what they comprise of. Moreover, I developed an understanding of the various system boundaries including isolated, open and closed systems.
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
In all honesty, the entirety of the workshop was new to me. Prior to the lesson, I was completely unaware of what a system was and the numerous components that form one. I didn’t know the different types of systems that existed in our everyday lives prior to the lesson. 
What insights have I gained?
I have overall gained the insight of what a system is and its importance in today’s society. I was unaware of how many systems are used on a daily basis in our lives and the complexity of such systems. Devices such as laptops have multiple systems integrated within them despite being portrayed as a simple  device to operate.  I have also recognised how significant humans are towards the functioning of systems around us. There are systems around us that can only operate with human assistance. 
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A weakness that I have observed is the fact that I struggle with staying focused/attentive for a long period of time. I tend to get distracted rather easily, especially during classes that are of 3 hour duration. A strength that I have observed is that I am able to absorb large amounts of information easily without feeling overwhelmed and losing track. Despite the distractions, I was able to comfortably get the jist of the lesson and understand the majority of the content.
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The main challenge that I encountered was trying to keep track of the amount of notes and material that was presented. As this class is 3 hours in duration, there are large amounts of material presented which can be difficult to keep track of and up-to-date regularly. Hence, to combat this issue I decided to try and stay more organised in regards to notes preparation every week. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would keep any distractions such as mobile phones away to prevent getting distracted during the lesson. In this manner, I can focus better and understand the challenging content being taught.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
I had a theory of placing my phone away from me during the lesson and only using it during the class breaks, with the aim of not getting distracted. I have learnt that being attentive in class can not only maximise results but also allow individuals to retain information easier, hence I am willing to follow this for the remaining semester.  
 
## Week 2:

What have I learnt this week?
I have learnt primarily about the many-models thinking mechanism and how this can heighten effectiveness and decision making in our everyday lives. I have learnt the importance of many-models thinking and how it can widen our perspectives .
What do I ‘now know’ that I did not before?
I have realised that I’ve been using the many-models approach often prior to learning about it. I used it specifically while I tutored. I used to think of multiple ways of explaining a particular concept to my student if she didn’t understand the theory. This was beneficial to my student as it facilitated the learning of the individual and advantageous for me as it allowed me to hone on my teaching and communication skills. 
What insights have I gained?
A specific insight that I have gained is the idea of bias associated with human thinking. I have recognised that some decisions we make are an output of biased thinking. Without realising, we can have partial thoughts, which is rather worrying. I have also gained the insight of hoping that the creation of models can aim to reduce the amount of biased thinking that individuals partake in.
     What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
The weakness that I mentioned previously, still appears to be prevalent as one. I find it difficult to stay completely focused throughout the lesson and get tempted to go on my phone during the class. However, I am aware that with time I will improve. A strength that I have recognised is that I am able to grasp course knowledge easier if I can re-write and summarise content in a simpler way after the lesson. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The only challenge that I encountered was being able to stay off my phone during the class. There were a few times where I did go on my phone for a few minutes and got distracted. However, I do believe that I handled the situation well as I didn’t go on my phone for as long as expected and put it away fairly quickly. I aim to reduce the number of times moving forward. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would consider placing my phone in another room to refrain myself from going on it too much and hence focus in class more. 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
All three of the theories based on the various approaches to models (analogy approach, embodiment approach and alternative reality approach), have been immensely useful in allowing me to interpret and understand all types of models. Through the analogy approach, I was able to gain insight on the more realistic models through incorporating reality. However, the alternative reality approach eliminates reality and the embodiment approach revolves around the notion of realism.

## Week 3:

What have I learnt this week?
This week, I learnt about the various types of models of thinking that are present which include:
Rational model
Rule-based model
Behavioural model 
I have learnt an overview on these models including their pros and cons which were demonstrated in various schemes. 
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
After this lesson, I have recognised that I usually think in behavioural perspectives which I didn’t know before. For example, I have always struggled with being able to stay focused for a long period of time and tend to procrastinate quite often. Despite knowing that I have commitments which I must prioritise, I will still choose to procrastinate them, which is essentially thinking in behavioural perspectives.
What insights have I gained?
I have gained insight on how the three models are integrated into individuals’ daily lives. I was unaware of how commonly individuals think using such models and how each model differs depending on the situations apparent.
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
During this lesson, I observed that a strength that I possessed was being able to link the course content to myself and self-reflect. This was advantageous as I was able to absorb the content taught significantly easier than other weeks as I could resonate with the different scenarios shown (in relation to the behavioural and rational thinking models). Although there is progress, the weakness I have still remains the same in relation to losing focus easily during the lesson due to distractions such as my mobile phone. However, I have recognised improvements in the sense that the frequency certainly reduced. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenge I encountered this week was procrastination with keeping up-to-date with the course notes. I didn’t handle this situation well as I didn’t end up completing the notes for the week and hence had to drag it to the following week. I aim to refrain facing situations like these in the future and will hone my organisational skills.
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time, I will place any form of distractions away from me while I am completing my work so the risk of procrastinating lessens. In addition to this, I will not drag pending work to the last-minute and complete it gradually on a daily basis. 
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of removing distractions from me is still hypothesised to be useful and would be incredibly beneficial in maximising productivity and overall results. Although this week’s outcome was unsuccessful, I still strongly believe in this theory and I aim to follow it for the remainder of the semester. 

## Week 4:

What have I learnt this week?
This week’s lesson revolved around the idea of networks, specifically the networks categorised into distributed, centralised and decentralised and the logic of networks. In addition to this, I also learnt about causal loop diagrams and its significance to our everyday lives.
What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
It was rather eye-opening to learn about the feedback section in relation to causal loop diagrams. causal loop diagrams are very beneficial in the sense that they can easily depict information in a graphical format and hence effectively portray the effect of one variable to another. I was completely unaware of causal loop diagrams and now have an extensive understanding of them. 
What insights have I gained?
I have gained insight on how the models can be applied in situations today such as the Covid-19 pandemic. I was unaware of how the models could be used to combat real-life situations and found it insightful finding out its effect towards our current pandemic virus.
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A perceived weakness that I observed this week was trying to grasp the content with ease. Although I stated previously that a core strength I possess is the ability to grasp and retain large amounts of information, I found that this week’s content was rather challenging to absorb. However, I aim to combat this issue by crafting and revising my notes without distractions. A strength I have observed is that I was able to easily form assignment groups and find platforms to communicate regularly. We also assigned the group leader relatively easily. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
I successfully created notes for this week with minimal distractions and caught up with pending work that was left incomplete from last week. Crafting simplified notes for this week’s content was highly beneficial in the sense that it made understanding the challenging concepts significantly easier. Ultimately, I feel that I have handled the challenges encountered well this week. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would continue to do what I did this week for any other weeks where I find the content challenging. Doing this will not only allow me to stay organised but also enhance my knowledge and understanding of this subject.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory of placing distractions such as phones away, proved to be useful this week as I was able to understand concepts that I found difficult during the lesson. Hence, I have understood that implementing this strategy in future weeks will be of great benefit if I am facing the same situation in the following lessons.

## Week 5:

What have I learnt this week?
This week, I have learnt about the ideas of probability distribution, normal distribution as well as long-tailed distributions. Probability distribution displays the entire set of outcomes in most commonly a graphical representation, that has a possibility of being chosen.  Normal distribution is a type of probability distribution with standard deviation and mean being the parameters. Its graph is symmetrical and looks similar to an upside-down parabola. Long-tailed distributions are shaped hyperbolically and have many occurrences from the centre of distribution. I have learnt that probability is used in various occasions of life such as guessing the weather and how it can determine a particular event occurring, whether it’s small or big. 
What do ‘now know’ that I did not before?
I now know about normal distribution and long-tailed distributions for which I didn’t know anything about prior to this class. I am now aware of these concepts and their graphical representations. Moreover, I have recognised how often we use probability in our daily lives without realising and how an outcome between 0-1 can determine the likeliness. 
What insights have I gained?
I gained insight after watching the TED talk which explained the use of probability in the form of power laws to predict when corporations will cease operating. It was surprising to hear the speaker inform everyone that all successful firms will cease operating one day through probability.
What are (the/my) perceived strengths/weaknesses that I have observed?
This week, there were no particular strengths and weaknesses that I observed as I progressed similarly to last week. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The main challenge I encountered this week was trying to understand the functioning of Python. I struggled despite thorough research and hence I handled the situation well by asking assistance from my group members.
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I should continue to voice my opinions to my group members without hesitation if I need assistance or have any opinion in general to say. This will prevent any chances of miscommunication arising and ensure an overall smooth process throughout the completion of the assignment.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory that proved to be useful was undoubtedly the aggregation of behaviours theory . From this theory, I have learnt that such theories can be highly beneficial in real-life situations as they can use predictions in determining future risks. 
 
## Week 6:

What have I learnt this week?
Through reflecting upon this week’s workshop, I have learnt that complex systems take a long period of time to grow and completely evolve. In addition to this, we learnt an overview on the Random Walk models and the riot, Markov models, contagion models, broadcast models and diffusion models. 
What do I now know that I didn’t know before?
Now I am aware that the majority of the models have intricate mathematical algorithms associated with them. I wasn’t aware that the models had such complex mathematics involved until learning the theory in this week’s workshop.
What insights have I gained?
I have gained insight on every model that was taught during the lesson, specifically in relation the evolution of the models. I have gained insight on path dependence, which essentially implies that present actions are interdependent on its prior ones. Moreover, I have also realised that the convex and concave of models that aren’t linear in shape can aid in estimating complex system behaviour.
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A strength that I have observed is my passion for mathematical concepts. I have always had a strong interest in mathematics, hence learning the mathematical concepts were eye-opening and I was able to grasp information and stay focused throughout the lesson. There were no perceived weaknesses that I have observed for this week except I still found python challenging to function which I am still working on with assistance. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenge that I have observed this week is the lack of communication present between our group. We didn’t communicate enough which led to inefficiency of the completion of set tasks.  We aim to make more group calls to increase the communication within our group and hence have better teamwork. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Moving forward, I aim to communicate more with my group members and initiate meetings & calls to keep track with the assignment and what models to decide. This would increase clarity, collaboration and prevent members from completing the work to the last-minute.
What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
Having written up-to-date notes has been beneficial for me to keep up with the course content and give me an idea on what to write for the pre-submission. Hence, I have learnt that continuing this way of learning will undoubtedly aid me when preparing for the final submission as well as the pre-submission.
 
## Week 7:

What have I learnt this week?
This week, I have learnt about the extensive multiculturalism present in Australia. I have realised that there are numerous diverse cultural backgrounds that are apparent in today’s society with immigrants constantly migrating. Despite the high levels of appreciation, I also learnt that differences could spark as a result of such a diverse environment, due to coordination. 
What do I now know that I didn’t know previously?
I am now aware of the concept of “replicator dynamics” and its influence towards social learning, which I didn’t hear of until this week’s lesson.  In addition to this, I have also recognised that the way individuals think and make decisions in today’s society can be an output of certain “social choices” that can come across as an influence. 
What are the insights that I’ve gained?
I have gained insight on how there are some aspects of human thinking that cannot be represented through a model. Sometimes decisions can be made as a result of various influences that have been placed such as social choices, religion, culture, values and likes/dislikes which cannot be represented through models. I found this extremely insightful and eye-opening as I was unaware of how models can not depict how these influences can impact thinking and making decisions.
What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
A perceived weakness that I have observed is not being able to speak up and voice my opinions, especially to my group as I feel hesitant. I am aware that this weakness can spark misunderstandings and overall inefficiency and I am aiming to combat this weakness in the future weeks by opening up. A strength that I have observed this week was not going on my phone at all during the lesson and having full focus during the class- I successfully combat my previous weaknesses. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The main challenge that I have encountered this week was procrastination. This is an issue that I have been struggling with since high-school and I am aware that I don’t handle this challenge well despite the efforts. Moving forward, I am aiming to not drag out upcoming work to the last minute and complete it bit-by-bit on a daily basis to prevent situations like these arising again.

## Week 8 - STUVAC

## Week 9:

What have I learnt this week?
This week’s workshop revolved around clarifying any doubts and concerns about the final submission of the assignment after submitting the pre-submission the week before. Despite significant efforts from all group members with the pre-submission, there were a few issues specifically regarding the third question that needed to be re-written. 
What do I now know that I didn’t know previously?
Now I know how to tackle the third section of the assignment following the feedback given by Juan. He clarified the doubts our group had with the third section as well as how to submit the assignment on Jupyter. Our group reflected upon the feedback given and planned accordingly on when to delegate group meetings so we can rectify the errors on section 3 and also on how to correctly handle Jupyter.
What insights have I gained?
The main insight I gained this week was the correct functioning of Jupyter. While Juan instructed our group, I found it fascinating as I was unaware and stuck on how the software properly worked until he explained step-by-step. 
What are (the/my perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
There were no perceived strengths that I have observed this week, except for successfully submitting my section of the pre-submission on time. However, a weakness that I observed was the difficulty of finding a time and day where all group members were available to conduct a group call. We struggled and were unsuccessful with finding a day to call. Moving forward, we aim to be more planned with our schedules so we can delegate group meetings. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
A challenge that I encountered this week was trying to balance my schedule in relation to extra-curricular activities with finding a time to call. Myself as well as my group members didn’t handle this situation well as we were unsuccessful with conducting a group meeting. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would plan better next time and let my group members prior about any additional commitments that I may have, so we can be more organised and hence conduct necessary group calls. 
 
## Week 10:

What have I learnt this week?
I have learnt the importance of communication that a team requires to successfully and efficiently complete upcoming tasks. I have recognised the negative consequences of not communicating properly and how that can spark miscommunication within the group. In addition to this, I learnt more about the functioning of Jupyter and Github with the assistance of Juan.
What do I now know that I didn’t know previously?
I now know how to submit work on Jupyter, which I didn’t know previously. After the assistance from Juan, I got clearly taught how Jupyter functions and now I feel more comfortable with its performance. 
What insights have I gained?
This week, I didn’t gain any insights as we solely worked on our assignment and how to submit it on Jupyter. 
What are (the/my perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
I have observed no perceived strengths this week however there were weaknesses present. The communication between the group was very minimal mainly due to the clashing of schedules. This led to miscommunication of information between all of us which undoubtedly lowered the efficiency and effectiveness amongst us. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The main challenge that our group faced was a lack of communication between our group. Specifically, myself and the other two group members were not on the same page as our team leader with the progress of the assignment. This led to miscommunication within the group in terms of what our expectations are. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would communicate more on the group chat to prevent misunderstandings and miscommunications like these from arising. 

## Week 11:

What have I learnt this week?
This week my health was severely impaired and hence I learnt that with my productivity levels significantly lessen with health ailments. 
What do I now know that I didn’t know previously?
I was unable to attend the class this week due to my sickness, hence there is nothing I now know that I didn’t know previously.
What insights did I gain?
There are no insights that I gained this week as I was unable to attend the class. 
What are (the/my) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
There were no perceived strengths that I observed this week. However, a weakness that I observed was not being able to stay as productive as I had hoped to. Being sick reduced my motivation to continue working. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The main challenge that I encountered was not feeling my healthiest which refrained me from attending the class and working at all. However, I handled the situation well by letting my group members know about my health issue. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Moving forward, I will handle the situation in the same manner and communicate how I’m feeling clearly to my group members. 
 
## Week 12:

What did I learn this week?
This week I didn’t learn anything new as our group spent the week resolving errors on section 3 of the assignment. We spent the time reviewing and editing that section of the report and didn’t actually learn any additional content. 
What do I now know that I didn’t know previously?
I now know the difference between what a model is and a theory as previously I thought that what we wrote were models, however I realised that they were actually theories after Juan’s feedback. 
What insights did I gain?
There were no particular insights that I gained this week. 
What are (the/my) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
The main weakness this week that I’ve observed is the lack of communication present in our group. This hindered the group’s overall productivity and greeted misunderstandings between us. 
What were the challenges I have encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The main challenge that our group faced was a lack of communication between our group. Specifically, myself and the other two group members were not on the same page as our team leader with the progress of the assignment. This led to the team leader taking the initiative and completing a section of the assignment by herself without letting the remaining group members know about this. She completed it to a significant quality and took the time and initiative however having clearer communication within the group about her decisions would have allowed the situation to be dealt with better as we would have assisted her. 
What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
Next time, I would openly ask Juan prior if I am struggling with any concept, section of the assignment or any issues with Jupyter instead of dragging queries to the last minute.

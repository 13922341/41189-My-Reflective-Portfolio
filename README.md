# 1- 
The beehive can be regarded as the system boundary in this case. Moreover, the system can be classified as open due to the fact that energy in the form of heat and temperature, as well as matter can enter in and out the beehive with ease. 
# 2- The system elements follow:
- The number of bees 
- The beehive’s temperature 
- The capability for the bees to generate heat 
# 3-  The external temperature constantly fluctuating causes the temperature of the beehive to change accordingly. The bees will have to partake in behavioural/structural/physiological adaptations to control the change in temperature.

It is the easiest to predict the system behaviour with the bees model. This is due to the fact that there is only one clear variable present- (weather), which will affect and determine the behaviour of the bees. 
# Which of the three models do you think is the most complex/adaptive and why
The most complex model would be the standing ovation model. This is primarily due to the presence of multiple variables which can affect the overall reaction of the standing ovation. While the bee model only has one variable, the standing ovation has multiple such as human behaviour and relationships making it significantly more complex and difficult to gage at what the outcome will be.

# Is many-model thinking taught or practices in any form in these different areas of your life? If yes, how and in what context? If no, why not?
Yes, I believe that I have used many-model thinking, specifically while I tutored. I used to think of multiple ways of explaining a particular concept to my student if she didn’t understand the theory. This was beneficial to my student as it facilitated the learning of the individual and advantageous for me as it allowed me to hone on my teaching and communication skills. 
# What are the risks of not adopting this mindset?
The risks of not adopting this mindset are:
Inaccurate data
Incorporation of bias 
Lack of clarity of data 
Lack of validity 
Lack of detail

Rational vs Behavioural vs Rule-based models
Rational models can be used for individuals or groups to partake in their own private decisions regarding goals, specific investments/purchases. Behavioural models revolve around one’s feelings and desires. This particular model is dependent and reliant on the way individuals think and react, which is why it is commonly used by businesses as a way to attract customers. Rule-based models are stringent and come with numerous restrictions that must be abided. 
 
# Decision Trees
Decision trees are highly convenient as all possibilities & options are distributed allowing individuals to delve deeper into each segment. They are commonly used in statistics and probability to segregate each possible option that may be chosen. 
 
# Signalling Models
Signalling observes individuals’ behavioural patterns which can consequently disclose information about them. This technique is beneficial for business, specifically in relation to determining what market sector will purchase their product. Signalling models is advantageous to determine consumer perception.
 
# Models of people’s value and power (LOTB and Shapley)
The shapley model is useful for teamwork activities as it enhances group efficiency & effectiveness as well as promoting impartiality. However, the LOTB model merely adds value for when the last person joins a group.
